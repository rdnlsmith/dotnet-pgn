# DotnetPgn

DotnetPgn is a [Portable Game Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation) parser
which I am implementing in C# for the fun of it, thanks largely to my
[recently-rediscovered interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen%27s_Gambit_(miniseries)) in
chess. Ultimately, I intend for it to comply fully with
[the PGN standard](http://www.saremba.de/chessgml/standards/pgn/pgn-complete.htm); currently, it is
in extremely early stages, and in any case it is not necessarily intended to ever be used in
production. There already exists a mature .NET Framework library in the form of
[iigorr/pgn.net](https://github.com/iigorr/pgn.net), as well as
[a .NET Core port by teodoran](https://github.com/teodoran/pgn.net).
